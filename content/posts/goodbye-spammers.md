I am one of those crazy people who run their own mail servers. I have been running it for almost 8 years now and I have a rather rudimentary anti-spam setup. I generally use unique tagged email addresses, then if I start getting spam to a particular email address, I will add a lovely `REJECT` to my mail config, and change the email address to a new one.

It took about 4 years for spammers to scrape the old Jekyll site and spam the `website@` alias, but only 4 *months* it seems to find the new `website2019@` address.

I contemplated a few schemes to obfuscate the address, or see if I could find a form provider, but ultimately I think the easiest thing is to cut the arms race off at the knees and just remove email as a contact method and ask people to ping me on LinkedIn instead.
