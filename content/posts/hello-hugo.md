I have just migrated the site to a new set-up.

It used to be a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static site hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) behind [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com).

The new set-up is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site behind [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

There was nothing wrong with the old set-up, but as I hadn't invested much time in learning Jekyll it wasn't much harder to start a clean new site than to relearn it.

I chose Netlify as I've just used them to host my domains [SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8461) sites.
